## **Hello, everyone!!!**

:rocket:##**This is an app training**:dart:

## This App is a simple App using js features, **storing up into a local storage**;

#### I made this app to train using this ***features without frameworks or libs***; The code is more verbose than with libs or frameworks,
but I think is important to know Vanilla Js, even though in my projects I use more Js frameworks;

#### That's App creates and removes Todos at a <ul> element
Beyond this, the Todos don't  'll be lost, and case localstorage is unable,
in virtue of deleting, the application won't throw an error, but just cast a empty "ul"

#### This app has a function what adds all items, deleting the last in every append() into DOM and rendering these items,
it's **RenderTodos()**. This function name(***RenderTodos()***) remembers the render() funtion in ReactJs, isn't it?
Yes, it's willfully!

:laughing:Making patterns is ever pretty great!
