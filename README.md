# AppTodos
This App is a simple App using js features, storing up into a local storage;

That's App creates and removes Todos at a <ul> element
Beyond this, the Todos don't  'll be lost, and case localstorage is unable,
in virtue of deleting, the application won't throw an error, but just cast a empty "ul"


This app has a function what adds all items, deleting the last in every append() into DOM and rendering these items,
it's RenderTodos()

See ya!
